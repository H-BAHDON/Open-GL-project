Module Leader: Dr Peter Passmore

	Aim: To demonstrate that you can use Open GL to draw 2D primitive shapes and transform them, and animate them over a number of scenes using various animation and viewing techniques.
	Specification: Create a multiple scene animation for the advertisement for a company of your choice.
	1). The coursework should include basic techniques such as double buffering, transformations, and multiple viewports.
	2.) There must be at least 3 scenes and it should last no more than 2 minutes.
	3). The course work may be extended for better grades by using advanced techniques like articulated object animation, tweening etc., or implementing it in 3D. Please check any extension work ideas with the tutor.
